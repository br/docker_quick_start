##Bleacher Report's Docker Quick Start Guide

Docker, Inc. provides a tremendous amount of [detailed references](http://docs.docker.com/) and a slick [online interactive tutorial](https://www.docker.com/tryit/) to ease Docker's learning curve.  We designed this guide on Docker to complement the official documentation already available, so our engineers may spin up some real use cases and start playing with Docker containers in the shortest amount of time possible.

This sample application is forked from the one developed and maintained by Michael Hartl for his self-paced learning program [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).  We dockerized it, so we may use it throughout our **[quick start guide on Docker](http://learningdocker.com/)**.
